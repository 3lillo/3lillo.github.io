# compatibily in romantic relationships

fantasizing about a parter with similar interests is not just romantic, but also parctical in my case. i'm in a phase of my life where i'm facing the fact that a life time is not enough to accomplish all my goals, build the knowledge i feel hungry for, experience all the art i feel drawn to.

"I can never read all the books I want; I can never be all the people I want and live all the lives I want. I can never train myself in all the skills I want. And why do I want? I want to live and feel all the shades, tones and variations of mental and physical experience possible in my life. And I am horribly limited." -sylvia plath

i, of course, try to see the beauty of this limitation and react to it with a strong motivation to not settle and push the bounderies of my realities by prioritizing meaningful experienses and by being "agentic" and aware of how my resources are allocated. i admit, nevertheless, that the weight of this conclusion is hard to bear sometimes.

this being said, sharing interest with a partner is practical because i recognise the finiteness of my resources and i don't think i would be able to allocate the ammount that is required for the partnership to function if there is not some overlap of interests and passion.

this framework of human connection is just the formalization of my empirical, personal experience. it is just how i found myself handling romantic relatioahips and i'm not saying that this is how i should interact, as a matter of fact, i have many doubts regarding this approach:
- where does the "not settling" end?
- interests and passions may change over time, for both parts, for better or worse
